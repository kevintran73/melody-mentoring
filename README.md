## Instructions

### Running the app on Docker

Run `docker compose up`.

Then reach the frontend on `http://localhost:3000/`

**If you make any changes to the files, first remove the existing docker builds** or run `docker compose build` to force a rebuild.

### Running the app locally

Please read through **both** readme files in `backend` and `frontend`:
- [Instructions for the frontend](frontend_web/README.md)
- [Instructions for the backend](backend/README.md)
